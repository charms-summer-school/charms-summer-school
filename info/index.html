    <h2>Getting here</h2>
    <p>
        In order to get to Versailles, one can either take a flight to one of the two Paris airports (CDG, ORY), or a train to Paris or Versailles. You can then use the local transport (bus, metro, tram, RER, taxi, etc.) to get to the university or the hotel. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The summer school will take place at the Faculty of Science of Université de Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines. Please find the Google Maps location below.

    <h2>Staying here</h2>
        <p>For people hosted by us, you will be staying at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/a4AeY5gLkhEQvDDd9"> Hotel de Lys (16 rue Richaud, 78000 Versailles) </a>, and will be sharing a twin room with another conference participant. The hotel stay includes breakfast.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
<p>
        The closest local station to the hotel is <b>Versailles Rive Droite</b>. We recommend downloading the app Citymapper and/or Bonjour RATP to plan your journeys here. Additionally, if you have time on the day of your arrival, we suggest obtaining a "<b>Navigo</b>" week pass for all zones at a Navigo counter (available at CDG airport and all train stations). This pass allows you to travel in the Paris region for one week (Monday to Sunday) and is the most cost-effective option if you plan to visit Paris frequently or are departing from one of the airports. Please remember to bring a picture of yourself (home printing is acceptable). More information can be found on these websites: https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/media/navigo-decouverte-travel-card and https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/navigo-weekly-ticket

        The talks will be held in room I of the Fermat Building (<b>Bâtiment Fermat, Amphithéâtre I</b>). You will be met by a guard at the campus entrance, who might ask you to show an ID and open your bag to verify its contents. On the first day, please show your invitation email (the one sent on March 12th or 14th). After that, we will provide you with a name tag which will serve as the ID.

       We will offer lunches from Tuesday to Friday to all our participants. These will take place at 12h40 at the campus cafeteria and we will leave the Room I at 12h30 sharp, since after 12h50 the cafeteria is quite busy. Lunch is in a buffet style and includes still water, bread, a starter, a main course and sides, cheese, dessert and/or fruit (you can choose up to 3 items besides the main course, not including bread). Everyday there are vegetarian, red meat and fish options to choose from. We have asked for the vegetarian option to be vegan. However, the cafeteria is unable to provide vegan cheese, and vegan desserts are not guaranteed. We apologize for these inconveniences.

       There are many nice restaurants to have dinner in Versailles. One of the closest to the university is Corte (pizzas and pasta) and l’Antre nous, but there are plenty of options around the area of Notre Dame market (Marché Notre Dame) and the Saint Louis neighborhood (a 35 min walk from the uni which we highly recommend). Versailles being a very touristy city, you can expect around 15-20€ for dinner. For slightly cheaper options (a little less than 15€), you can try out a traditional crêperie or go for fast food options that can be found near Notre Dame market You can also grab a sandwich at a bakery or at the university cafeteria (before 15h). Unfortunately, we won’t be able to cover dinner expenses for our participants but we might organize an informal school dinner on Thursday!

       <h2>Other activities</h2>
    <p>For those of you who climb, there is a bouldering gym in Versailles (https://blocbuster.fr/versailles/#les-tarifs). It is quite expensive, but you can get a reduced fare if you have a student card with you. A cheaper option (not including transportation) is available in Arkose Massy (but only after 21h30, before that it is as expensive as Versailles). 
    
    </p>
    <h2>Leaving here</h2>
<p>For those of you leaving on Friday afternoon, we might be able to store your luggage in the Math department in the morning. Please approach one of the organizers during the school to get more information (we have limited space).
